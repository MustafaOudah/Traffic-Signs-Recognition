1- This project represents the simulation part of my master's thesis " DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE ENHANCED BY ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS (ADAS) USING ML"

2- In this project we developed and train a LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network to classify traffic signs provided by the user. 

3- We used " German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)" dataset /// https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_dataset.html.

4- We design graphic user interface to help the user to classified different type of traffic signs by using " mustafa_app.py".# Traffic-Signs-Recognition
